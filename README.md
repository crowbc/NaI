# NaI
Notes on NaI simulation:

Sodium iodide detector simulation for Geant4 v 11.1(beta)

Current build will generate energy spectrum from depositions in scoring volume.

Note: Current build will simulate scintillation photons, but number of hits seems to be far less than what the scoring volume energy spectrum indicates should be present.

# Simulation Output
Simulation output stored in NaIoutput$RunNumber$_t$threadNumber$.root (output file name is hard coded.)

Thread outputs can be merged by typing:

	hadd nameOfMergedFile.root NaIoutput$RunNumber$_t{0..n}.root
	
, where n one less than the number of threads used to run the batch (max thread index)

for merging all threads into a single Root file for a particular run number. Alternatively, typing:

	hadd nameOfMergedFile.root NaIoutput*_t{0..n}.root

will merge all threads of all runs into a single Root file.

# Running the simulation
To run simulations in batch mode, type the following command:

	./NaI macroName.mac

To run with the visualizer, type:

	./NaI

(note - the default source of a geantino redefined as a Co-60 decay ion will be used, but no events will be generated by the visualizer macro)

To generate events using the default source and default settings, type /run/beamOn N, where N is the number of events you wish to simulate. See
Geant4 documentation for using other particles and sources using the visualizer commands while using this mode to run simulations.
